# XBimDemo
A short demo of using the XBim toolkit to process models, generate geometry and extract semantic and geometric data

Uses XBimEssentials and XBimGeometry to open, parse and generate xbim and wexbim semantic and geometric models. 

Using that it shows how to get bounding boxes of all products in the model and show their dimensions and placement.
